# WEATHER APP FLUTTER

In this project I have created a basic weather app using the Open Weather API. The main concern
of this project is learning flutter. I have learned many new concepts while developing this app
like asynchronous programming, flutter layout widgets, and Material design. You are welcome to
to review my code and give me feedback for imrovements.
